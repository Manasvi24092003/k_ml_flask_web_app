## Business Problem

### Objective
- Maximize sales by identifying and targeting cross-selling opportunities.

### Constraints
- Minimize customer retention.

### Success Criteria
- Business Success Criteria: Increase sales by 10% to 12%.
- ML Success Criteria: Achieve a Silhouette coefficient of at least 0.6.
- Economic Success Criteria: Increase revenues by at least 8%.

### Problem Statements
- Analyze and understand travel patterns, customer demand, and terminal usage to optimize airline and terminal operations.

## Solution Approach

This project follows the CRISP-ML(Q) process model, consisting of six phases:

1. Business and Data Understanding
2. Data Preparation
3. Model Building
4. Model Evaluation
5. Deployment
6. Monitoring and Maintenance

```

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/air-traffic-clustering.git
    cd air-traffic-clustering
    ```

2. **Install the required packages**:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn sklearn sweetviz kneed sqlalchemy flask pymysql joblib
    ```

## Usage

### 1. Data Processing and Model Training

Run the following command to process data and train the clustering model:

```bash
python data_processing_model_training.py
```

### 2. Run the Flask App

Start the Flask app by running:

```bash
python app.py
```

### 3. Access the Web Interface

Open a browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to upload your file and enter database credentials.

### 4. Use the API for Prediction

Send a POST request to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/predict` with the JSON body:

```json
{
    "features": [value1, value2, ..., valueN]
}
```

## API Endpoints

- `GET /`: Home page with file upload and database credentials form.
- `POST /predict`: Processes the uploaded file and database credentials, trains the model, and displays results.
- `POST /api/predict`: API endpoint for making predictions.
